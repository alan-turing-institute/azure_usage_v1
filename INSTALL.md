# ‚ú® Azure usage

Repository for the WebApp and complimentary notebooks to analyse Azure usage at the Alan Turing Institute.

## üóÑÔ∏è Data

The data for the Turing is available from the `Research Engineering` OneDrive / Sharepoint Documents folder (‚Å®see Research Engineering - Documents‚Å© ‚ñ∏ ‚Å®Research_Computing_Platforms‚Å© ‚ñ∏ ‚Å®Azure‚Å© ‚ñ∏ ‚Å®usage_data‚Å© ‚ñ∏ ‚Å®sponsorship_portal‚Å© ‚ñ∏ concatenated).

Data in the form of csv file(s) as extracted from the portal should be placed in the `data` folder in the main directory:

- Copy all usage data files into a `data` folder in the top-level of this repository.

- **Or**, from the main Azure_usage directory execute the following command in order to prepare a single csv file to be imported by the WebApp:

  `python utils/prep_data.py -o data/ -i <full_path_to_extracted_data_files>`

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Building and publishing on **Azure**

From command line in the main directory:

To build: `make build`

To publish: `make push`

Webhooks will notice the push of the new deployment and automatically update the webapp.

## üñ•Ô∏è Running WebApp locally

### Dependencies

- Python >= 3.6
- Pip
- Additional libraries as listed in requirements.txt

  Python libraries can be installed using pip as follows:
  `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Local deployment

To launch the WebApp execute the following command in the terminal in the main directory:
`./RUN.sh`

The WebApp is then accessible via a browser:
`http://localhost:80`
